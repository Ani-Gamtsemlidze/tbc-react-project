        Veganism is an enormous topic encompassing nutrition, animal protection,
        food politics, and more. In this short piece I’ll introduce the concept
        and explain its vast appeal. The word vegan was originally defined as a
        diet free of meat, dairy products, and eggs.

        The term now also refers to any item, from shoes to shampoo, made
        without animal products. Vegan diets offer compelling advantages on
        several fronts. They keep farm animals out of slaughterhouses and
        factory farms.

        Choosing vegan foods can also benefit your health and protect the
        environment. A careful look at the reasons to go vegan is well worth
        your time. But our objective right now is to quickly cover the basics.
        So let’s keep moving.
